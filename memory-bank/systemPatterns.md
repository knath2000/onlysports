# System Patterns: Dynamic Sports Match Tracker

**Version:** 1.0 (Initial)
**Date:** 2025-04-11

## 1. Architecture
*   **Chosen Pattern:** Clean Architecture (or a layered variant inspired by it)
*   **Candidates:** Clean Architecture, MVVM, MVC
*   **Rationale for Choice:** Selected for its strong separation of concerns (Presentation, Domain/Application, Data/Infrastructure), which enhances testability, maintainability, and scalability. Aligns well with the project's goals for high quality, performance focus, and future expansion. Provides clear boundaries for development.
*   **Diagrams/Flows:** (To be added as architecture solidifies)

## 2. State Management
*   **Chosen Solution:** Riverpod
*   **Candidates:** Riverpod, Bloc, Provider, GetX
*   **Rationale for Choice:** Chosen for its performance, compile-time safety, flexibility, scalability, and automatic provider disposal. Well-suited for handling asynchronous operations (API calls, real-time data) and managing potentially complex UI state related to animations with relatively less boilerplate compared to Bloc.

## 3. Data Flow
*   (To be detailed once API, Architecture, and State Management are chosen)
*   Example: API -> Repository -> Use Case -> State Notifier -> UI

## 4. Key Design Patterns (Anticipated)
*   Repository Pattern (for data abstraction)
*   Dependency Injection (likely provided by state management solution or dedicated package)
*   Observer Pattern (inherent in reactive state management)
*   Builder Pattern (for complex object creation, e.g., theme data)

*(This file will document the high-level architectural decisions, state management approach, and recurring design patterns used throughout the application. It will be populated primarily during Step 4).*
