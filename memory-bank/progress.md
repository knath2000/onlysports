# Progress Tracker: Dynamic Sports Match Tracker

**Version:** 1.0 (Initial)
**Date:** 2025-04-11 (Updated after GitHub Push)

## 1. Current Status (Post-Phase 1 Refinements)
*   Initial implementation of gradient background theme complete.
*   Match details now shown in a modal popup with background blur.
*   Skeleton loading screens (`skeletonizer`) implemented for main loading states.
10| *   Local dev environment (`vercel dev`) issues resolved.
11| *   Application builds and runs on Web, macOS, iOS with basic functionality.

13| ## 2. What Works
14| *   Displaying Upcoming/Previous Matches via Tabs (with gradient background).
15| *   Fetching data from football-data.org via Vercel Proxy (`vercel dev` locally).
16| *   Displaying match details in a modal popup with background blur.
17| *   Adding/Removing favorite teams using Hive persistence (via star button).
18| *   Drag-and-drop favoriting (MatchListItem -> Drop Target on MatchListScreen).
19| *   Filtering match list by favorites (using toggle button).
20| *   Basic caching of fetched match details and lists using Hive.
21| *   Cross-platform builds (Web, macOS, iOS).
22| *   Mandatory initial league selection screen (with visual selector).
23| *   Ability to change league selection from main screen (via edit button).
24| *   Skeleton loading states using `skeletonizer` for lists and modal.
25| *   Displaying Team Crests & League Emblems (via Vercel proxy for CORS).
26| ## 3. What's Next (High Level)
27| *   Performance Optimization & Profiling (Based on current report).
28| *   UI/UX Polish (Refine gradient theme, custom components, glossy effects?).
29| *   Implement complex animations using Rive.
30| *   Implement robust filtering for match lists.
31| *   Improve error handling.
32| *   Code Refinement (Address TODOs).
33| *   Update core Memory Bank docs (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`) to match current gradient theme direction.
## 4. Known Issues / Blockers
*   ~~API Key currently hardcoded in Firebase Function (Security Risk).~~ (Fixed - Moved to Vercel env var)
*   Polling for live updates is basic and subject to rate limits/API update frequency.
40| *   UI lacks final polish (custom components, glossy effects, refined animations).
41| *   Filtering logic is basic (only home/away team ID via toggle).
42| *   Drag-and-drop target area is the whole list view, could be refined.
43| *   Skeleton loading appearance might need tweaking.

## 6. Performance Notes (Initial - Post Lighthouse)
*   Release builds completed successfully for all platforms.
*   Initial Lighthouse (CanvasKit renderer) showed poor performance (Score ~86, ~59MB payload).
*   Switched web renderer to **HTML** in `web/index.html`.
*   Re-run Lighthouse (HTML renderer) showed **significant improvement**:
    *   Payload reduced to ~2.2MB.
    *   Speed Index improved from ~126s to ~1.5s.
    *   JS Execution Time reduced from ~5.1s to ~1.7s.
    *   Accessibility score improved to 92.
    *   SEO score improved to 100.
    *   LCP/TBT errors persist, likely due to HTML renderer measurement difficulties - monitor as app complexity increases.
*   No major performance issues noted during basic functional testing on native platforms.
*   Detailed profiling (DevTools, Lighthouse) still required as per Step 12 / Post Phase 1.
