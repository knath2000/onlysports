# Progress Tracker: Dynamic Sports Match Tracker

**Version:** 1.0 (Initial)
**Date:** 2025-04-11

## 1. Current Status (End of Phase 1)
*   Completed initial 12-step development plan (`PLAN.md`).
*   Core functionality for Soccer (Phase 1) is implemented at a basic level.
*   Application builds and runs on Web, macOS, iOS.

## 2. What Works (Basic Level)
*   Displaying Upcoming/Previous Matches via Tabs.
*   Fetching data from football-data.org via Firebase Proxy.
*   Navigating to Match Detail Screen.
*   Displaying basic match details.
*   Basic polling for live updates on detail screen.
*   Adding/Removing favorite teams using Hive persistence.
*   Filtering match list by favorites (using Hive data).
*   Basic caching of fetched match details and lists using Hive.
*   Cross-platform builds (Web, macOS, iOS).

## 3. What's Next (Post Phase 1 - High Level)
*   Step 2: Research Soccer Data APIs
*   Step 3: Research UI/Animation Inspiration & Libraries
*   Step 4: Decide on State Management & Architecture
*   ... (See `PLAN.md` for full list)

*   UI/UX Polish (Theme, Custom Components, Animations - Rive).
*   Robust Filtering Implementation.
*   Performance Optimization & Profiling.
*   Improved Error Handling & Loading States.
*   Code Refinement (Address TODOs, API Key Security).

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers
*   ~~API Key currently hardcoded in Firebase Function (Security Risk).~~ (Fixed - Moved to Vercel env var)
*   Polling for live updates is basic and subject to rate limits/API update frequency.
*   UI is basic, lacks the planned custom components and animations.
*   Filtering logic is basic (only home/away team ID).

## 5. Key Milestones Reached (Phase 1)
*   Project Plan Finalized (2025-04-11)
*   Memory Bank Initialized (2025-04-11)
*   Phase 1 Core Functionality Implemented (Basic) (2025-04-11)
*   Cross-Platform Builds Successful (2025-04-11)
*   Web App Deployed & Working via Vercel (using Serverless Function Proxy) (2025-04-11)
*   Integrated Hive for Favorites & Match Caching (2025-04-11)

## 6. Performance Notes (Initial - Post Lighthouse)
*   Release builds completed successfully for all platforms.
*   Initial Lighthouse (CanvasKit renderer) showed poor performance (Score ~86, ~59MB payload).
*   Switched web renderer to **HTML** in `web/index.html`.
*   Re-run Lighthouse (HTML renderer) showed **significant improvement**:
    *   Payload reduced to ~2.2MB.
    *   Speed Index improved from ~126s to ~1.5s.
    *   JS Execution Time reduced from ~5.1s to ~1.7s.
    *   Accessibility score improved to 92.
    *   SEO score improved to 100.
    *   LCP/TBT errors persist, likely due to HTML renderer measurement difficulties - monitor as app complexity increases.
*   No major performance issues noted during basic functional testing on native platforms.
*   Detailed profiling (DevTools, Lighthouse) still required as per Step 12 / Post Phase 1.
