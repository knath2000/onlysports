# Project Brief: Dynamic Sports Match Tracker

**Version:** 1.0 (Initial)
**Date:** 2025-04-11

## 1. Project Title
Dynamic Sports Match Tracker (Initial Focus: Soccer)

## 2. Project Vision & Goal
Develop a highly polished, visually engaging, and exceptionally performant application for tracking upcoming and previous sports matches. The initial release will focus exclusively on soccer. The app aims to differentiate itself through a unique, game-inspired user interface, complex animations, and best-in-class performance metrics across all target platforms.

## 3. Core Functionality (Phase 1 - Soccer)
*   Display lists of upcoming soccer matches (filterable by date, league, team).
*   Display results of previous soccer matches (including scores, key events like goals/cards if available).
*   View basic match details (date, time, teams involved, league/competition, venue).
*   Ability to mark favorite teams or leagues for quick access/filtering.
*   Real-time score updates for ongoing matches (if data source permits).

## 4. Target Platforms
*   **Web:** Mobile-first responsive design, scaling gracefully to desktop views.
*   **macOS:** Native desktop application experience.
*   **iOS:** Native mobile application experience.
*   *(Cross-platform consistency in core features and branding is key, while respecting platform-specific UI conventions where appropriate).*

## 5. Design & User Experience (UX) - High Level
*   **Base Theme:** Strict adherence to a dark theme inspired by Apple.com's aesthetic (deep grey/black backgrounds, high contrast, minimalist color, clean lines, generous spacing).
*   **Animation & Visual Language:** Contrast the dark theme with bursts of bright, vibrant colors *exclusively* within fluid, complex, "game-like" animations (page transitions, micro-interactions, data visualization).
*   **UI Elements:** Utilize custom widgets and iconography to reinforce the unique feel.
*   **Overall Feel:** Interactive, dynamic, sleek, modern, slightly futuristic, with playful energy from animations.

## 6. Technical Specifications (Initial Thoughts)
*   **Framework:** Flutter/Dart.
*   **State Management:** To be determined (Candidates: Riverpod, Bloc, Provider, GetX).
*   **Architecture:** To be determined (Candidates: Clean Architecture, MVVM, MVC).
*   **Animation Libraries:** Consider Rive, Lottie, Flutter's built-in framework.
*   **Data Source:** Requires investigation and selection (Sports API).

## 7. Performance Requirements & Goals
*   **Web:** Lighthouse scores > 90 (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO). Fast FCP, LCP, TTI.
*   **Mobile/Desktop:** Smooth 60+ FPS (target 120 FPS). Minimal jank, low memory, fast startup.
*   **Strategy:** Emphasize performance from day one (efficient state management, minimize rebuilds, code splitting, shader optimization, image optimization, platform tuning).

## 8. Key Differentiators
*   Unique blend of sophisticated dark UI with vibrant, game-like animations.
*   Exceptional, measurable performance across all platforms.
*   Highly polished and fluid user experience.

## 9. Future Considerations (Post-Phase 1)
*   Expanding to other sports (Basketball, F1, Tennis).
*   Deeper statistics (player stats, head-to-head).
*   User accounts and personalization.
*   Push notifications.
*   Integration of news/social feeds.
